            </p>
            <p>
                Dear diary, I decided to condense my morning hours into one chunk and write about it. I had originally planned to write this journal hourly but trying to write an entry takes away time from doing things I would normally do. And that is my problem with this task and journalling in general. I require myself to split into two, one doing and thinking, and another thinking about doing and thinking about thinking. 

            </p>
            <p>
                 This results in an eerie split mind, as though there are two people sharing one body. So then, every action I take feels inauthentic and every reflection I make is artificial. Even during my most private moments, the thought of having to mentally record or reflect on my actions retracts me from the full experience. 

            </p>   
            <p>
                Still I will attempt to find meaningful things to reflect on, in hopes that this will aid my project. 

            </p>         
            <p>
               My family is worried for me. I am still in the UK and the coronavirus situation keeps getting worse every day. I was told by my father that my grandmother has heard about this and is worried about me. She is a person with a lot of worries but not a lot of words. 

            </p>
            <p>
              Our 1 minute conversation went as follows: 

            </p>
            <p>
            	Who is it? - Its me, Sun Min
				Oh my dear, are you back home? - No I’m still in London 
				I heard the situation in UK is very bad - yes 
				Don’t go out anywhere - yes 
				You need to stay at home - I’m doing that grandma
				Eat a lot at home, you need to stay healthy - yes, I’m eating 
				How is studying? - the schools are closed here
				Ok be well - you too, keep healthy
				Ok bye - goodbye. 

            </p>

            <p>
               Due the current situation, this is a slight deviation from our normal conversations but otherwise the basic structure of our phone calls over the years remain constant. 
 
            </p>
            <p>
            	I might just give a quick rundown of my daily routine stuck in quarantine. The timings are not precise and there is a couple hours of leeway depending on how I’m feeling during the day. 

            </p>

            <p>
            	Morning-ish: Wake up, eat, clean, call parents, work out, shower

Noon-to-afternoon: watch tv, draw on ipad, read, enjoy sun on balcony, call friends, eat lunch

Night: game, watch tv, call friends, sleep

            </p>

            <p>
            	
            	Its not the most productive routine. During the beginning of Easter I had online courses, small projects and other productive routines going. I had a timetable that I stuck to, mostly. However, I’m now okay with just doing whatever feels right. Its relieved a lot of the pressure that I put on myself and I have a lot of fun everyday. 

            </p>

            <p>
            	
            	I think I have a productive personality however, once I identify myself with that, I start putting pressure on myself. That prevents me from enjoying the recreational and relaxing time I have to myself. I start to feel guilty for having fun and despise the work I do. This quarantine gave me the opportunity to find a balance by allowing my inclination towards ‘productive’ things take charge of my actions rather than feeling like I ‘ought’ to do those things.
            </p>

            <p>
            	I think that is also why I am struggling to do this journal. After a few weeks of doing things when I wanted and how I wanted, I am required to do something. Still, it has served me so far by giving me insight into my state of life and state of mind at this current time. I will check back in later, I fully expect the rest of the day to go as explained above. 

            </p>
            <p class="p1">
13:00 - 16:50 afternoon

            </p>

            <p>
            	The day went as according to plan. Though there isn’t much to prevent that from happening. Perhaps apart from writing this entry. 

            </p>


<p>
	After the last entry, I spent a long time drawing on my ipad. I’ve been trying to get better at painting digitally, its something that I have been trying to do for a long time now. I’ve drawn using my iPad for the last couple of days now and I can see improvement. I believe it it because I’ve just been enjoying the process of drawing rather than consciously ‘practicing’. Its weird how sometimes you can try too hard to improve that it backfires on you. 
</p>

<p>
	I don’t remember where I saw this but somewhere along my path in art and design, I was told of a gap. This gap was the one between my expectations and my actual skill level. If this gap was too big, I would get demotivated. If the gap was too small, I would never progress. Therefore, I was told I need to keep this gap manageable, make my aspirations realistic. 

</p>

<p>
	
I stayed true to this idea for a little while. It made sense. But I learnt something last term during my Classroom brief. I realised that I was creating things for school, and I was making things for my future self. I was motivated by the prospect of success in the future. However, that left me with little motivation to work. It was when I started to do things for myself in the present moment that I felt like I was having fun again. I was enjoying creating things. 
</p>

<p>
	The idea of the split self keeps coming up in my thinking. The aforementioned future self, and the reflecting self that I discussed in the morning entry. Its an overused maxim but ‘just be yourself’ is more relevant to me than ever. However, even that phrase itself splits a person in two. One not being themselves and another trying to make themselves be themselves. Its a bit of a fun mind twister but once you see it, its hard to stop finding moments in which you must split yourself into multiple bits. 

</p>

<p>
	When Zizek discusses ideology, he uses the Freudian term ‘the Big other’ which refers to a part of ourselves that surveils us, critiques us and disciplines us. Social expectations, culture, and ideologies are imbedded within us and we are careful to live within these cultural and social parameters as to not be shunned by society. However, this often creates a duality within oneself. 

</p>

<p>
	It reminds me of John Berger’s chapter on nudes in The ways of seeing; he discusses how women have had to become both the surveyor and surveyed. From a young age, he argued, women were taught and encouraged to present themselves in an acceptable manner, they are always looked upon by the male gaze and to be able to ‘correct’ themselves they needed to understand how they were looked at. In the same manner, people are required to view themselves in the eyes of others, in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of themselves; big other. 
</p>

<p>
	One could see this quality/phenomenon as simple ‘self-conscious’ or as serious as it being ‘oppressive’, perhaps depending on the severity of the scrutiny. However, I think it is quite an unnatural thing to do and the ability of do so must stem from a very human aspect, consciousness. 

</p>

<p>This is a very complicated topic and I am nowhere near well equipped to discuss it thoroughly or in very much depth at all. However, this is something I am interested in and will continue to think about for a long time. Not now though, its only the first week of summer term and I haven’t been able to have a nap today :(
</p>

<p class="p1">
	18:00 - 23:33 evening

</p>

<p>
	 It is now the evening, the rest of my day has been spent well without really worrying about this task or reflection. I think it was partly because I started to accept that this task was just an introductory one, and also because I spent the majority of that time playing video games with my friends. 
</p>

<p>
	
	I get immense enjoyment out of playing online video games with my high school friends. We have all played this one game in particular called League of Legends for around 8 years now. I have had moments where I left the game alone but always end up coming back to it. Its an experience that I look forward to every night, these days. 

</p>

<p>
	Though social distancing measure prevent me from seeing my friends in person, I am still able to interact and socialise with them through this medium. And while it has been getting more attention these days, I think gaming and interactivity is really underrated. It can be an immersive narrative, a persuasive tool, an engaging tool for education, connect people and build communities. 

</p>

<p>
	Although, I criticised the ways in which technology and screens has created a medium for reproductions and representations of reality to replace reality. Gaming can be seen under a different light. While the digital image has convinced the consumer that the image of reality is the same as reality, thereby creating a veneer of fabrication, interactive space in gaming can provide an extension to reality, as though pushing the physical capability of reality. 

</p>

<p>
	I am also interested in the pockets of subculture that is created around gaming. There are certainly many video game players in the world but they do not automatically fall into the sphere of people who identify with the ‘gamer’ culture. Whats more, every game has its own unique player-fan-base with its own in-jokes, terminology, meta-commentary and so on. I’m not familiar with a lot of these communities but they are a fascinating example of the social bubbles that exist in today’s age. Specifically I’m interested in how reality is seen through and are often shaped by the socio-cultural lenses of these niche in-groups.
</p>

<p>
	Its also interesting how gaming culture changes across countries. I have been able to experience 3 different distinct cultures, Hong Kong, Korea and the UK. Although, I don’t have any in depth knowledge or first hand experience with the gaming communities there. I can compare the general perception of gaming within those cultures. 

</p>

<p>
	In Korea, gaming culture is quite advanced to say the least. They had a cable channel for e-sports long before the big money makers such as LoL, CS GO or other big competitive games became mainstream called OGN. Koreans are really accepting of new technology and enjoy high speed internet anywhere. This laid the groundwork for the well developed scene of gaming in Korea. 

</p>

<p>
	The same can be said for Hong Kong, but if they were a couple years behind. However, the societal perception of gamers can be quite negative, they are often seen as lazy, dumb, and/or delinquents. Additionally there are a lot of negative social pressures in those countries that may drive a lot of people to find an escape in video games (video game addiction is quite a big an issue in Korea). 

</p>

<p>
	Although, the UK gaming scene may not be as well funded, professional or developed, it is getting there. Also, it seems as though the perception of gamers are just neutral if not positive. Having been to the video game exhibition in the V&A in London, I saw that here gaming was celebrated. 

</p>

<p>I ended up delving into this topic because of my love of gaming with my friends. Though I was admittedly trying to pad this journal with a bit more writing at first, I started to find interesting thoughts about this passion of mine that I treasure but not really share. 
</p>

<p>
	For now there is no resolution to the questions and trains-of-thought brought up in this reflective journal. Maybe I will explore them in this brief, maybe not. It was fun. Goodnight.

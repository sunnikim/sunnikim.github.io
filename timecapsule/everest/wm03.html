For a few years now we have been using the nuclear power plants made possible by the technologically revered company Everest to bring us cheap and clean energy. They claimed to have made leaps in nuclear fission technology to increase its efficiency rate and entirely eliminate the toxic waste chemicals. BUT what they don’t want you to know if that they are doing this at the expense of our FUTURE! Literally.
</p>
<p>
Recent expose documents on wiki leaks confirm the TRUE nature of these nuclear power plants that PROVE Everest has been LYING to us. 
</p>
<p>
What they said was a development in nuclear fission technology was actually the discovery of something similar in nature to the hypothetical ‘tachyon’ particle. A tachyon particle is faster than the speed of light, and they harnessed its power to break spacetime. The ‘clean’ energy we are using is actually powered a ‘time reactor’ which uses time particles extracted from the future. MEANING, we are using more energy today at the expense of time in the future!
</p>
<p>
Look at these graphs, they show the projected time decay in the future that will occur due to this exploitation of time particles. 
</p>
<p>
Eventually this amount of time will catch up to us. <br>THE END OF OUR TIME. 
</p>
<p>
COUNTDOWN TILL THE END OF OUR DAYS. 
</p>
<p>
I hear you argue ‘but time is infinite’. Isn’t that what we also believe of water? It was a basic fundamental right to have access to clean water, it was boundless and for everyone to use. Now we are being sold time just as we have been sold water. The capitalists are commoditising even the fundamental universal resource, time. 
</p>
<p>
Even if it wasn’t infinite, surely there must be enough future time to expend for a little bit? NO! It may not concern you because it is not affecting us right now but this will slowly kill us. With our ever growing population and growing demand for energy we will need to expend more future time. Additionally, once we start tampering with time, siphoning our future will mean our time right now will be stretched thin. Isn’t that obvious? We might not feel the effects now but it will slowly accelerate until it is too late!
</p>
<p>
The greed for a source of cheap energy must not come at the expense of our future lives, our children and their children’s lives. What will the future of humanity say when they run out of time? Will there even be a future for us? How will we be able to fix what we have done? There might not be a solution, we have to stop NOW!
</p>
<p>
These days people are a slave to technology. They worship every new ‘innovation’. NO! WAKE UP PEOPLE. This is not the next step for humanity. The Technocrats, Deep State, The New World Order. This is all part of their plan. They are trying to fool us for global governance and money! Not every piece of technology is good for us. 
</p>
<p>
THIS IS REALITY. READ THE PAPERS.
</p>
<p>
Don’t believe everything the government and their paid ‘scientists’ tell you. Stop worshiping them for making your life a little more comfortable. Always be critical, always be skeptical and think for yourself! I admit I’m not an expert but no one is. Not even you. I’m always trying to find out the truth and you should too. Don’t put your faith in ‘experts’. These people are funded researchers who are biased for large corporations and the elite members of society. These globalists are vying for dominance. They are trying to rule us. We the people need to rise up against these evil tech corporations, they are using technology that they don’t even understand! 
</p>
<p>
Our reality and ‘scientific truths’ are just things we trust. Why should we trust these people in power? They are shaping our very reality to keep themselves in power. STOP AND THINK! WAKE UP AND SEE CLEARLY.

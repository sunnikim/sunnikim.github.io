               Broken System

            <p class="p1">How much carbon do you consume?</p>

            <p>
               Our group’s provocation is “how much carbon do you consume?” I am most interested in the word ‘consume’, because to me climate change seems to be a deeply economic problem. Of course there are social, cultural and political aspects to the issue, but for me they arise from the root of an economic model, Capitalism. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The simplest model of any free market economy can be drawn up with a demand curve and a supply curve. By allowing the producers and consumers of our economy decide at what price and what quantity goods and services should be made, the free market forces supposedly allocate our resources efficiently. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Yet, the agents of these markets, corporate producers and individual consumers, aren’t entirely rational actors. Producers distribute defected products to save on cost of a recall. Bankers sell risky mortgages that cripple the economy. We spend a lot of money of on goods we don’t need on the promise of a better life. The market is in the end driven by human actors, and humans are imperfect. Especially when they are incentivised by the economic model to pursue profits. 
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
            The current economic system has altered our culture and society, to seek short term profits, to act individualistically and to consume more. 
            </p>

            <p>
            This idea that the world is unfair, its cruel and unforgiving, may have some truth to it but to me it seems more and more like a lie we tell ourselves to cope with a broken system. This isn’t how the world needs to be and this isn’t how the world will be forever.

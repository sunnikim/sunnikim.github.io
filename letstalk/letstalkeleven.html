Be comfortable with silence, <br></span>it can encourage them to open up. We shouldnâ€™t always try <br>to relate or try to problem solve. We can let them just rant. </p>

               <p class="leftblock">Be honest and say what comes to mind. Even if its <br>a negative comment. Being authentic creates a chance <br>for deeper connections.   </p>

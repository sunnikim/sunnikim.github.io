            Dear Team Suzuki 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            My name is Sun Min Kim and I go by Sunny. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I am a graphic communication designer who has recently graduated from Central Saint Martins. My design practice in university revolved around building experiences and environments to evoke a critical response from my audience. Specifically, I was interested in prodding at how the saturation of visual culture form habitual patterns of thought and perception. In essence, my practice was using graphic design to take a critical look at graphic design.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I considered many ways to disrupt the viewer’s default expectations of experiences. In one instance, I developed a camera program that took the user’s photo a few seconds before they click the shutter. Revealing an unflattering, unprepared yet completely authentic image of themselves. Something we are not used to in these visually dominant times. This project was called ‘Cameras Do Lie’.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Indeed, my practice naturally wandered towards sound and its counteractive potential to the ‘flattening’ of everyday life into two dimensional images. In another project, ‘Digital Life Assistant’, my colleague and I created an audio narrative experience that transports the listener 150 years into the future. This speculative project expressed a critical look at the trajectory of human communication and was proposed as part of the 150 Anniversary of the Postcard exhibition with the Postal Museum. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Personally, I believe there is a lot to be explored with sound design, especially in relation to graphic communication design. I’m interested in what can be done with the synthesis of sound and sight but also what the absence of either can do. In this hyper visual culture, sound asks us to slow down, listen and pay attention. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Recently, my journey with sound, music and design has started becoming more intertwined. I am currently using my free time to develop a web application that makes music visualisation more accessible to casual users. I am developing this under the guidance of Joel Gethin Lewis at UAL’s Creative Computing Institute and with a dear friend and colleague Leo Dubois (who is also applying for a position and whom I completely vouch for).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>          
            I want to get in touch with your team because I want to work towards something playful and inspiring. When I went to visit the Sonic Bloom installation, I met a child who asked me to help lift him to interact with the megaphones because he was too small to reach it. I had a delightful experience as we continued to play and bond through the installation. It’s the little things in life that make it beautiful and I hope to be a part of a team that creates such wonderful experiences. 
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
            As for myself, I can offer nothing but curiosity, sincerity and kindness. These are the values that build both my personal character and my professional design practice. They drive my willingness to learn, to be patient, to fail and to learn again; taking me through and across many different creative fields and disciplines. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I believe I will be a good fit for both the graphic design internship position as well as the junior graphic designer position. I hope that after reading this that you believe so too. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Thank you
            </p>

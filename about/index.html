               <p class="leftblock" id="first"> Hi! Nice to meet you! I’m Sunny, a CSM GCD graduate of class 2021. What would you like to know about me?</p>
               
               <div>
               <p class="rightblock"> What do you do? </p>
               
               <p class="leftblock" id="man"> I see myself as a theoretically minded designer who is conceptually driven. However, I have a knack for creating things on my own. My interests in several different creative disciplines stem from my insatiable appetite to learn and experience new things.</p>
                </div>

               <p class="rightblock"> So you’re multidisciplinary? </p>

               <p class="leftblock"> Yes, though admittedly this leaves me with less depth of expertise as I spread my attention across multiple fields, I find that this frees my design practice from conventionality. Additionally, by not constraining my practice to one discipline I am flexible and am able to think laterally. I believe it is a strength to be able to apply my design thinking to accommodate the purpose of various end goals. 
                <br>
                <br>

                Following this, it is my hope to meet people in my career who believe my curiosity and interest in pushing design in new directions a valuable asset to their professional and creative aspirations. 
                <br><br>


                Having recently graduated I am eager put myself into the field of graphic and communication design, learning from experience and excelling in the field.</p>

                <p class="rightblock"> Are you good at x, y and z? </p>


                <p class="leftblock"> In terms of hard skills, I have always been a fast learner and find that I can reach a level of competency for most things in a short span of time.
                <br><br>
                I have great confidence in my abilities in: 
                <br><br>
                Image manipulation and poster production (Photoshop)<br>
                Graphics and vector design (Illustrator)<br>
                Video editing (Premiere Pro)<br>
                Drawing and Illustration<br>
                Photography 
                <br><br>
                I’ve reached a respectable level of competency in: 
                <br><br>
                Front end Web design (HTML, CSS, JS)<br>
                Animation (hand drawn, After effects) <br>
                <br><br>
                I am still working on improving: 
                <br><br>
                Creative coding and programming <br>
                Film production <br>
                Print making 
                <br><br>
                I am always keen on improving, learning and getting better. 
                </p>

                <p class="rightblock"> Conceptual? </p>

                <p class="leftblock"> I spent my time at Central Saint Martin’s developing my design thinking and adopting the conceptual mindset that was characteristic of the institution. 
                <br><br>
                During this time I was interested in combining theories of cultural psychology, post-modern philosophy and sociolinguistics into my design practice. 
                <br><br>
                Specifically, I am fascinated with how our framework of reality and perception is altered, for better or worse, by the degradation of authenticity through social media, the proliferation of digital images and the commodification of all spheres of life. 
                <br><br>
                These matters, I believe, are deeply intertwined with the practice of graphic communication design and informs my personal worldview, which then inevitably feeds into my designs. 
                </p>

                <p class="rightblock"> What is your design process like? </p>

                <p class="leftblock"> I’m a firm believer in the idea that inspiration strikes with hard work. My design process starts with defining the core problem, researching the topic and conceptualising a solution. Often I am eager to begin prototyping and creating demos to visualise and test ideas. Then its a matter of iterative work, pushing the idea into new and interesting depths then pulling it back into feasibility and functionality. 
                </p>

                <p class="rightblock"> What do you aim for your designs to do? </p>

                <p class="leftblock"> I am focused on user experience, meaning and emotions. I am interested in creating a certain experience for the user. This doesn’t need to be anything big but a small intervention within their expectations of things that create a impact. It is within these experiences that I seek to send a message, to communicate an idea. 
                </p>

                <p class="rightblock"> A little bit about yourself? </p>

                <p class="leftblock"> I’m well acquainted with the city life. I was born in Seoul, raised in Hong Kong and attended university in London. The vibrant and busy pace of life has definitely become embedded in who I am but with it comes a yearning for peace and quiet. Though I’m not a religious person, I align myself with the spirituality of Buddhism and Eastern philosophy. 
                <br><br>

                I am privileged to have attended an international school in Hong Kong, where I learnt English and garnered a more open world view. This was thanks to my father’s resilience and hard-work, finally finding success with his business in China. His strong character is something I am proud to have inherited. From my mother’s side I have taken her curiosity for life and openness to new experiences and new people.  
                </p>

                <p class="rightblock">Can I get to know you better? </p>

                <p class="leftblock"> Yes! Please get in touch :) whether its to work together on something, to share ideas or just for a chat. <br><br> My email is sunminkim1999@gmail.com 
                </p>

                The Google definition for ‘museum’ is ‘a building in which objects of historical, scientific, artistic, or cultural interest are stored and exhibited.’ This is an apt definition for most people, a museum is a house of muse, of ‘interests’. Generally, the museum is seen as an agent for cultural preservation and education. However, much like Illich’s view of how schooling instills capitalist ideologies in students, the museum plays a integral role in shaping the social and cultural future, not just remembering its past.

                   The museum represents a temple of knowledge for a particular community. Carol Duncan examines how the rise of secularism co-aligns with the increasing importance of museums as a place for intellectual and cultural insight. She likens it to a religious experience, except in the place of God, there is the ‘truth’ or ‘knowledge’.

                Similar to how Foucault argues the new language of science and medicine allows for subjects/individuals to be suppressed through new definitions and labels, museums now hold power in defining what is beautiful art, what is important knowledge and what requires our attention at the given moment. This becomes problematic as when a few number of curators dictate what the public sees, access to knowledge and what is deemed as knowledge (as well as culture) becomes authoritarian. As museums are concerned with public education, there is a responsibility in creating a democratic and representative exhibit.

                This is imperative in our technological age where the internet has allowed for the proliferation of information but also facilitated the spread of misinformation and propaganda. The public’s trust in museums as a bastion of truth should not be betrayed with biases, under-representation and indoctrination.

                Still, its easy to see how museums are designed to be exclusive and ritualistic. Objects that are place in museums or galleries have an elevated sense of importance, not only because the curator decided it so but because the audience believe it as well. The architecture of a museum signals an air of untouchability. The walls are pristine white, the objects are lock safely within a glass case, and they are often raised on a plinth. The museum is often not a comfortable place, and it has been built intentionally so.

                    A person not versed in the etiquette or rituals of museums feel out of place. Its been shown in many studies that museums goers have generally completed a high level of education. This kind of elitism is perpetuated by creating a separate building that houses ‘objects of knowledge’. It can be argued that the museum becomes a designated space for the ‘cultured’ and promotes class divisions.

                    Yet, even those who frequent museums are subject to its intentions and rituals. The signs and layout of a exhibit will have been carefully constructed so that the viewer experiences what the curator wants them to. This is compounded with the social expectation that one will gain something from the experience. So that one feels an overwhelming obligation to find the displays fascinating and insightful.

                    Bazin describes the typical experience eloquently. Statues must be isolated in space, paintings hung far apart, a glittering jewel placed against a field of black velvet and spot-lighted; in principle, only one object at a time should appear in the field of vision. Iconographic meaning, overall harmony, aspects that attracted the nineteenth-century amateur, no longer interest the contemporary museum goer, who is obsessed with form and workmanship; the eye must be able to scan slowly the entire surface of a painting. The act of looking becomes a sort of trance uniting spectator and masterpiece.

                    It could be argued that this environment is beneficial in learning about a certain cultural object, or observing a work of art. However, I would argue that this experience has become so expected - through all the signs, architecture and pressure - that it becomes inevitable. And in that way it is fabricated and meaningless.

                    What is more, after an exhibition there are now gift shops that sell a miniature version of recognisable displays. The experience is then reduced to a decoration through the commodification of culture. That can be argue to be another role of the museum.

                    The question then is how can the museum be improved under this scrutiny? Is it possible to have a centralised collection of cultural objects and knowledge that is not autocratic? Can the public organise a shared exhibition that is fully democratic and representative?

                Perhaps it is the intrinsic nature of museums to be biased, and under representative. After all, a museum with no intention, no curation is impossible. Additionally, I am not arguing against curated exhibitions. However, if museums truly are to educate the public it needs be a reciprocal relationship.

				Hi, I'm Sunny, a visual communicator and graphic designer. 
				<br> I was born in Korea and raised in Hong Kong. 
				<br>
				<br> I'm also a student on the 2nd year of Central Saint Martin's BA Graphic Communication Design Course. 
				
				<br> At the moment my practice is multi-disciplinary and traverses many different fields. 
				<br> Currently I am interested in exploring how our human experiences and social relations are altered with the proliferation of digital images. What are the consequences of our fixation on sharing events and spectacles in the virtual realm as it begins to permeate our perception of reality?
				<br> More of this conceptual stuff can be found in my 'flatness of reality' CSM project.
				<br>
				<br> Otherwise, this portfolio contains different projects that span across various mediums
				<br> Thanks for visitng my website and I hope you enjoy looking at my work! 
				<br>
				<br> if you would like to work together please send me an email: sunminkim1999@gmail.com

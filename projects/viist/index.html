    <p>This project was a social media app concept. I felt there was a lack of social media apps that were actually based
    around social interaction, instead they were mostly designed to maximised hours of attention spent on there to increase
    advertising revenue.
    </p>
    <p>     
    My service intentionally avoids these predatory design practices, instead opting to make design decisions that make for
    genuine social interaction and provide opportunities for the therapeutic and meaningful conversations that I believe can
    help improve the mental health of my users.

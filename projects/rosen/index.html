    <h2>Unconditional Love and Support</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    This project is a speculative design about a digital robot that gives the user love. This love is not romantic love, but
    one closer to parental love, approval from an respected figure or the ancient greek idea of Storge.</p>
    <p>
    In Roger’s developmental theory, he posits that those who were given more unconditional love in childhood will show more
    signs for higher self-worth. This carries on into adulthood and allows them to take risks and accept failure. Thus they
    are more likely to self-actualise and become what he calls a ‘fully functioning person’.</p>
    <p>
    However, in many regard most people lack this sense of self- worth, perhaps partly due to the ever increasing standard
    of the ideal self and as discussed try to manifest their ideal self online.</p>
    <p>
    We are so preoccupied with creating an image of ourselves people will love, so that we may then love ourselves. This can
    never be achieved because no one is looking at us, they are hoping you will look at them, love them.</p>
    <p>
    Borrowing from Frued’s idea of that a large part of our psyche is hidden in our unconscious ‘shadow’ and that our
    neurosis stem from this repressed, deeper side of our personality. This robot, takes on the image of a user’s parent,
    teacher, coach or any authority figure and shows the user unconditional love, to tap into and heal that unconscious part
    of our psyche.</p>
    <p>
    This will allow them to develop a stronger sense of self- worth, allowing them to self actualise and spend more precious
    time paying attention to others, their loved ones.</p>
    <p>
    
    The solution I developed here is intentionally problematic. What is the ethical implications of using someone else’s
    image to heal our psychological wounds?</p>
    <p>
    I want the viewer to also question whether or not this love received from the robot is real love. Does it matter when it
    add to happiness of the user and contributes positively to society?</p>
    <p>
    Could it arguably be better than the dopamine hit inducing love we garner from the number of likes, comments and
    followers that trap us within a meaningless feedback loop?</p>
    <p>
    To what extent should we rely on technology to solve our psychological, mental and emotional problems?</p>
    <p>
    What happens when we love this simulacra in the same way we are beginning to love the digital image of ourselves?</p>

            <h1>
               <span class="overline"> Are our emotions our own?</span>  <span class="underline"></span>
            </h1>
        
            <p>
            Instinctually it is a definite yes. How can your own emotions ever be separated from you? If anything at all, you are
            your emotions and feelings. Is there something else you can point to that makes you you? You name, your profession, your
            memories. Indeed these are all integral to your concept of yourself and others’ understanding of who you are but in this
            present moment you act based on your emotions and feelings, do you not?
            </p>
            <p>
            True, there is logic and reasoning. I will not hit you even if you make me angry because I know through reasoning that
            it won’t solve any problems. However, that forethought is also based on emotions. I don’t want to feel bad after hitting
            you, those emotions of guilt and regret are not worth the gratification that comes from punching you in the face.
            </p>
            <p>
            So emotions are all we have then and they are who we are. Does placing a label on these feelings help us in anyway? Its
            useful in communicating to others how we are feeling. ‘I am feeling lonely. So please come give me a hug’ or ‘I am angry
            at you for now so give me some space’. Does there come a point where these definitions are limiting?
            </p>
            <p>
            Anger is defined as a ‘strong feeling of annoyance, displeasure or hostility’. However, these are just other feelings.
            Therefore definitions become a circular thing, meaning is ever displaced. Are words the only ways to understand our
            emotions? There are a multitude of different words for a slight variation in feeling and perhaps an articulate person
            can string together the perfect combination of word to accurately represent their inner self. But even then, are they
            truly expressing their emotions?
            </p>
            <p>
            What if by defining these changing and elusive feelings we are giving up a deeper, visceral understanding of them in
            exchange for hardcoded, representative definitions. Is there a science to knowing ourselves? Can we observe and
            categorise our inner being, create hypothesis and test them? Is it repeatable, verifiable and predictable? If we trust
            that these words express a unified feeling across all of us are we believing in an objectivity of subjective experience?
            </p>
            <p>
            These labels become our reality, they become our emotions. We give power to these words and then they overtake the
            meaning itself. For example, why do we want happiness? Does saying ‘I’m happy’ actually mean you’re happy? These words
            are tokens that symbolise real emotions but are easily mistaken for reality itself. We chase happiness like we pursue
            fiat money. Is there any inherent value in these symbols? Or do we give it meaning?
            </p>
            <p>
            Then the question becomes why are we chasing this thing? Do we genuinely want it? Is its value actually warranted or has
            it become inflated by the amount of people chasing it. Have we ever stopped to question what it even is?
            </p>
            <p>
            So we place so much importance on this idea of happiness, this ghost, that we start to sacrifice everything for it. I
            start to hate you for getting in the way of my happiness. I start to work long hours and save money. It seems other
            people have it but we don’t. Even if we know its a facade we can’t help but be jealous. If you show the signs of
            happiness as well will you be able to convince yourself that you are indeed happy?
            </p>
            <p>
            Where did this idea even come from? In the absence of God have we turned to Happiness as the ultimate pursuit? Has the
            idea been coopted into the dominant ideologies that govern our social, cultural and economic framework? These realities
            are often questioned but never escapable. Even those who do question it seek it in another form, through the abandonment
            of social constructs they believe they can find happiness. But ‘happiness’ isn’t real, emotions are and emotions change.
            </p>
            <p>
            The counter cultural philosophies, that we might align with self-help, self-love, self-esteem, that grew from the 60s
            New Age era might agree with this abandonment of definitions and the embrace of listening to a true inner self. However
            their pursuit of the authentic self, of being ‘real’, can also be misleading. Underneath all the layers of social
            agreements we adhere to is there a genuine soul? A consistent, authentic, real self that one can point to?
            </p>
            <p>
            This line of thinking leads to a confusing place where even our entirety of being can be said to be a continual product
            of influences that are endlessly displaced through our cultural history. Are our emotions then owed to our ancestors?
            The value of individualism rooted in greek philosophy? Our social radar for inclusion stemming from the pack behaviour
            of apes. Our fight or flight system from even before?
            </p>
            <p>
            Peace might be found when one learns from Buddhist philosophy which seems to have figured out the ever changing nature
            of the self long ago. They embrace the idea of deconstructing the self, ridding the mind of all conventional knowledge.
            This is knowledge that exists solely on a socially understood basis, this includes words and definitions which point to
            reality but can never be real. As well as the conventional knowledge of self, that there is something called ‘I’ or
            someone to be named.
            </p>
            <p>
            All this is not to find the ‘authentic self’, not only would that defeat the purpose, it would be impossible for a
            person without conception of self to pursue anything at all. They are at peace being adrift in a world of wordless
            feelings and meaningless happenings.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is not to say problems go away once you don’t believe in the definitions of happiness. The world does not disappear
            when you cover your eyes, though it is an attractive possibility. There are problems to be solved and issues to be dealt
            with that go beyond the individual, beyond you or me, and our emotions, our feelings. However, we are often so caught up
            in them. This is precisely why our emotional being is what companies, politicians and manipulative people prey on.
            </p>
            <p>
            Increasingly our emotions are no longer our own. We are exposed to countless carefully chosen images, words and sounds
            that sway our opinion. The targeted propaganda that influenced the Trump election and Brexit shows how dangerous our
            data is; how easily our opinions can be made for us. Our realities are becoming divided. It is much easier to hate
            someone if you think you are in the right. Your emotions are valid because you believe that your reality is the true
            reality. However we are in an age where everyone is being manipulated. In an ever increasingly complex state of affairs
            no one truly knows what is going on.
            </p>
            <p>
            In a world of disinformation is it wise to act solely on emotions? Is it wise to put so much value on the idea of
            happiness, especially my happiness over yours? Is there a danger in believing in a certain reality as fundamental and
            never changing?
            </p>
            <p>
            At least by questioning our emotions we question ourself and by questioning our selves we think about what really
            matters to us. Am I hating a particular set of people and loving my tribe of people because of who I truly am or because
            I have become influenced to think this way? Are our emotions truly our own?

    <p>What are the implications of the growing image culture in our society? We put so much weight on the value of sight,
    seeing is after all believing. The proliferation of digital images in our everyday lives alters the ways in which we
    perceive reality. Within these new frameworks of perception are power structures that serve to the cultural hegemony of
    Neo-liberalism. Beyond ideological impacts, we begin to value capturing the moment rather than living and experiencing
    it.

    Too often one is satisfied with substituting real substance with superficial veneer of images, regardless of whether
    that is taking photographs in museums instead of attempting to connect with a painting or engineering a scene so that
    the photographed subjects may appear more aesthetically pleasing.

    to? What happens when..

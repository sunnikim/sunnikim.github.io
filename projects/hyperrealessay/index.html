    <textarea id="result" readonly placeholder="We live in Hyperreality. A state where truth has disconnected from reality due to the embrace of simulacra, or image, as real. Better put, truth is indistinguishable from representation of truth to the extent that the distinction does not matter anymore; simulation has become reality. 

Hyperreality becomes more pronounced as our media technology becomes more advanced. Now machines, or more accurately machine learning, can produce images, text and art comparable to ‘real’ version created by humans (whatever that means in a state where reality no longer exists). 

This website was an experiment in creating a ‘fake’ essay to reflect hyperreality. Within this cultural era which is more real, an auto generated essay or an ‘authentic’ one? Unfortunately the experiment failed and the AI model produces gibberish. 

Is it a stretch to say this might actually reflect us more poignantly? That, at this point, our input and output loop of hollowed out simulacra are just as meaningless as the incoherent mumbo jumbo my model generates? Probably. 

Even if the experiment was successful and created a believable essay, the culture which accepts simulacra as real began long before the technological capacity to imitate life-like and human-like art, literature, music etc. 

The fortunate news is knowledge of hyperreality frees us from dogmas of truth. Here is where I make the connection to existentialism. If nothing (and everything) is real then all meaning is made equal. There exists new and exciting possibilities to live, make art and understand the world. 

Though I must admit, from the first hand experience of a 21 year old (for what it’s worth), this is not that easy. I mean just try to make sense out of this shit.

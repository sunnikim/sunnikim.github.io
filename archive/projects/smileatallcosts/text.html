            Its a gross over simplification but usually one stops there. It becomes hard to penetrate the depth of our motivations
            further than that. It feels counterintuitive to question why someone would want to be happy. Its obvious. Happiness is
            the key to living a good life. Sure, there are different ways we choose to pursue happiness but the goal itself does not
            need an explanation. It is understood that happiness is inherently good in and of itself.

            <br><br>
            
            What good does one get to question happiness as the end goal?

            <br><br>
            
            I argue that it is important that we routinely question the fundamental suppositions over which we lead our lives. Only
            then can we claim to be fully in control of our own decisions. If we simply accept the nature of our being as it is then
            we surrender ourselves to the status quo, remaining a product of our culture. I understand a simple thought exercise is
            hardly revolutionary but it is my hope that it serves as a warm-up to more rigorous interrogations of the self and the
            views one holds. It does not matter whether one returns to the conclusion that happiness truly is the greatest pursuit
            of life, the point is that they have first questioned it. By deconstructing the firmly held beliefs that construct our
            framework of reality, we open the possibilities for alternate ways of being, can become more empathetic towards the
            views of others and increase the likelihood for progressive social change.

            <br><br>
            
            Allow me to illustrate one possible journey of thought.

            <br><br>
            
            <span style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">Why do I want to be happy?</span>

            <br><br>
            
            ‘Its natural! I programmed to be pleasure seeking and pain minimising. I am, after all, evolved to be this way; I am an
            animal.’ If this were true then the best life lived would be one where one feels extreme pleasure, through opiates and
            amphetamines, hijacking the brain’s pleasure system. It would be a short life, not just because that amount of drugs
            would no doubt leave one’s healthy in serious jeopardy but so that not one moment of depression can settle in.

            <br><br>
            
            Of course, most would not agree that this is a life well lived. We would be no different than rats who rather press
            buttons for dopamine than eat for sustenance. However, as we learn more about human psychology and its relations to the
            science of neurology, should we begin to override the normal function of our brains? If we were able to be happy all the
            time why not choose to do so? If it is natural to want to be happy, is it also natural to follow that desire to its end
            and administer a concoction of chemicals into our system, when such a wonder drug becomes available?

            <br><br>
            
            This brings into mind the classic though experiment of the Experience Machine. If given the choice to plug into a
            machine that could simulate a pleasurable experience for the rest of your life, indistinguishable from reality, would
            you? If one is hesitant to plug in, then there might be something of value greater than happiness itself. Perhaps its
            the fact that it would take away from an authentic experience of life.

            <br><br>
            
            If anything at all such a life would grow dull, as we become accustomed to the heightened pleasure. It would require
            more increased intensities of stimulation to rouse the sense and tickle the receptors. This could not continue forever,
            except one could argue this is where we are currently at. Our senses are continually being stimulated, our attention
            span is decreasing along with our capacity to marvel at the little things. ‘I am no longer impressed by much, I’ve seen
            it all before.’ We are novelty experiencing machines. Even those who live by the sea get tired of it.

            <br><br>
            
            Why would anyone submit themselves to continual stimulation to the point where it dulls the senses? Maybe by holding
            happiness at the highest value, we would rather be in a marginally more pleasurable state than not. It is this hedonic
            treadmill that motivates one to continue consuming unnecessary products, to continue to drink increasing amounts, to
            look for better opportunities rather than appreciate the good we have in our life at this very moment.

            <br><br>
            
            If pleasurable experience does not equate to a life well lived then perhaps another definition of happiness may serve us
            better. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi suggests that we find greatest happiness in the flow state. A state in which we are
            meaningfully engaged in an activity in which there is a balance between how skilled one is and how challenging it can
            be. For instance musicians who are entirely engrossed within their performance are said to be in the flow state. Within
            this state of mind, one loses their sense of time and place, becoming in touch with the Eternal Now. Well it goes
            without saying that one cannot continuously play music forever.

            <br><br>
            
            There comes a point where you are not in a flow state, but here the seminal figure of the 60s Human Potential Movement,
            Alan Watts might provide us with relevant wisdom. He suggests that one should approach life in the manner in which one
            plays music. The point is not to reach the end of the song, or the crescendo, or the drop, as soon as possible or for
            long as possible. For if that was the case then the best performances would be a cacophony of sounds all played at once.
            Instead there are moments of silence in between that make up the rhythms and the meandering of notes that make up the
            melodies. Life lived in this way, with mindfulness of each moment, allows one to enjoy the flow state, in the loosest
            definition, continuously.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Another concept of positive psychology stemming from the Human Potential Movement is the idea of self-actualisation, of
            fulfilling your full potential, of becoming who you are. Psychologist Carl Rogers would agree that the highest motivator
            within us is the desire to reach self-actualisation. The concept at first sounds promising, there is truly something
            positive about becoming the best self one can be. However, this discrepancy between one’s ideal self and one’s actual
            self is becoming evermore distanced and complicated.

            <br><br>
            
            During that era, these psychological developments were taken further into action and boosting the self-esteem of
            children became popular. Participation trophies and medals were introduced, grades were boosted slightly. All under the
            assumption that low self esteem was a predictor of unsociable traits. Yet, this only served to undermine the drive to
            work harder and achieve more. If things came easy there was no need to try. Turns out self esteem is a great social
            indicator within our psyche to detect whether we are succeeding within the culture of our tribe. If all signs read
            positive, then one felt content. Except, of course, they were false positives.

            <br><br>
            
            This cultural phenomenon can be argued to still be influential today. The problem is that through social media, one’s
            idea of themselves is becoming evermore distant from their actual self. Through identity performance on online
            platforms, one is able to curate their online persona in the image of the ideal self. Becoming the best self one can be
            virtually is not the same as working towards it in actuality. As a result the large discrepancy between the conception
            of one’s self and their actual being results in what Rogers identifies as incongruence, a psychological state that leads
            to neurosis. An unfortunate case in point, a high level of perfectionism, where one’s ideal self is too far to reach, is
            understood now to be a predictor of suicide.

            <br><br>
            
            The complication now is that everyone performs their ideal self on social media, to the effect that everyone appears to
            be happy. As happiness is regarded as of highest value, it is no surprise that smiling is now second nature to anyone
            whose photo is being taken. Yet are we capturing a moment of happiness or are we simply performing the act of being
            happy? Jean Baudrillard might argue that it doesn’t matter. We have reached a point where representation has replaced
            reality, in fact representation has become a reality in its own right, a hyperreality. Known as the precession of
            simulacra, the image of happiness is as, or more valuable than real happiness. Indeed, what does ‘real’ happiness feel
            like? Has the word, idea, and image come to replace the visceral knowledge and experience entirely? Watts provides an
            apt analogy of needing to tear down blue coloured curtains in order to see the sky.

            <br><br>
            
            Previous criticisms of Capitalism might focus on how the idea of happiness is sold to consumers, preying on their
            hedonistic tendencies and the never ending treadmill. Here one could cite John Berger who comments on the publicity
            image as stealing the love of oneself only to offer it back for the price of the product. In its more developed form,
            Late-Capitalism is no longer preserved through a relationship between the producer and the consumer, but through the
            self maintaining culture of consumers.

            <br><br>
            
            When engaging with social media, we allow our love of ourselves to be stolen, only to be given it back when we accrue
            virtual hearts. By participating in this new form of online society we perpetuate a culture of false happiness. Guy
            Debord was one of the first to note the degradation of self value from the characteristics on one’s self to what one
            has, and from what one has to what one appears to have. In order to convince others and ourselves of our happiness we
            must continue to post the luxury goods and lavish experiences we indulge ourselves in. Thus, we flatten ourselves into
            an image, the perfect life, an experience commodified ‘and possible if you too work hard and spend money on the things
            that I did!’ The Capital machine no longer needs to do any work, we trap ourselves within a system that repress us. It
            appears a self perpetual machine is not impossible after all.

            <br><br>
            
            Our voluntary compliance within this system is no surprise to Herbert Marcuse. In One Dimensional man, he proposes the
            concept of Repressive Desublimation, a new form of ideological control. In order to repress dissent and oppositional
            thought, the dominant system allows for the illusion of freedom and individuality. The freedom to satisfy one’s self
            through the comforts and pleasures of consumerism. It borrows from Freud’s idea of sublimation in which one channels
            their repressed (sexual) energy into something else, art making for example, or even rebellious thought.
            Counterintuitively, we are allowed marginal freedom, and comforts, so there is less energy to be repressed and therefore
            less to rebel against. Ultimately, the desire to transcend the dominant system dissipates.

            <br><br>
            
            Even countercultural movements are subsumed into the Capital apparatus and are commodified. Frederic Jameson argues that
            within our post modern era, culture and historicity is aestheticised through commodification, resulting in what he
            describes as ‘depthlessness’. Within this state of affairs all countercultural efforts are fruitless as they operate
            within a system of cultural hegemony.

            <br><br>
            
            To draw on the ideas of happiness, there is a resurgence of certain rhetoric popular in the countercultural era of the
            60s. Only this time it enters a field of depthless aesthetics, of commodification and corporatisation. Self-help gurus
            selling their course online. Expensive classes of novelty yoga. Mindfulness classes to improve focus and productivity at
            work. There is a stronger sense that happiness is achievable in a culture of well being. These are in many ways arguably
            a positive force within society, a possible opening towards deeper understanding of a life well lived.

            <br><br>
            
            Yet it feels these are only surface level products. Within my own field of graphic design there seems to be a trend in
            bright colors, cartoonish illustrations and bubbly lettering reminiscent of the 60s. These are mere stylisations of
            happiness. Does surrounding ourselves in images of ‘happy and wholesome vibes’ lead to a happy life? Does a work place
            with gyms, meditation rooms and recreation activities, lead to increased well being or does it blur the lines of work
            and life?

            <br><br>
            
            In this a certain sense, optimism, positivity and happiness can be seen as the 21st Century’s opiate of the masses. It
            covers the people in a blanket of comfort, so that one would rather stay in bed and sleep than face the challenges of
            the day. We must be comfortable and content, lest we over turn the entire system. So happiness, happiness at all costs.
            Even as the system does not serve us meaningfully. Even as inequality widens and levels of consumption plunge us towards
            global catastrophe. Have we have become so distanced from reality, reaching a state of ‘hyperreal psychosis’, that we
            continue to seek happiness? Or perhaps being happy is all we can do, to at least try in the face of an entirely absurd
            existence and, in many ways, tragic state of reality.

            <br><br>
            
            Still, the more we strive for happiness the more it feels out of reach, the more we drive ourselves into a system that
            doesn’t care for us, the more we devalue the moments of life in between. The more we value our own happiness, the less
            important other’s happiness becomes. Perhaps happiness is not a state of being nor a purpose of being but a symptom of
            being.

            <br><br>
            
            This was just the one possible journey of thought, based on specific influences and personal biases. However, I hope it
            proves to some level that when we begin the question fundamental suppositions of life we uncover the roots of our being.
            It reveals the flexibility of meaning and often flimsy foundations of culture. We are then no longer just a product of
            our culture, we are free to make our own decisions. One who understands the fluid nature of our frameworks of reality
            can be more empathetic, even to those hard set on their ways. Finally, I urge the reader to not just question the
            accepted forms of happiness to reach their own personal definition of happiness, but to question the desire for
            happiness itself, for everyone’s goal in life should not be defined and dictated by a single word.</p>

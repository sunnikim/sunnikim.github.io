        ‘Whats your name?’, they asked.
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn’t have one yet. I had no recollection of how I got here.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘I’m not from here’
    </p>
    <p>
        They didn’t seem to understand me.
    </p> 
    <p>
        ‘In this world you are alone.’
    </p>
    <p>
        There were edges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Something to be separated by or be connected to.
    </p>
    <p> 
        …
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Is there more?’
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Yes, there is!’
    </p>
    <p>
        Wow.
    </p>
    <p>
        …
    </p>
    <p>
        So I wandered. Learned of many things.
    </p>
    <p>
        I stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Time continued.
    </p>
    <p>
        …
    </p>
    <p>
        Then I had to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘But I haven’t seen everything yet!’

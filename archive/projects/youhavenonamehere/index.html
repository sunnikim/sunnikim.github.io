    <p>
        ‘You have no name here’, they said.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had no recollection of how I got here.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘I’m not from here’
    </p>
    <p>
        They didn’t seem to understand me.
    </p> 
    <p>
        ‘In this world you are never alone. Isn’t it nice?’
    </p>
    <p>
        We supposed it was.
    </p>
    <p>
        There were no edges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing to be separated by or be connected to.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was it. All there was.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wow.
    </p>
    <p> 
        …
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Is that it?’
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Yea, guess so’
    </p>
    <p>
        …
    </p>
    <p>
        All encompassing boredom seeped in.
    </p>
    <p>
        We stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Time continued.
    </p>
    <p>
        …
    </p>
    <p>
        A decision to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘But we don’t know whats on the other side!’

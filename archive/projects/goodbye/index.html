    <p>The moral of this narrative draws from Baudrillard’s understanding of the ‘Precession of Simulacra’. Where the signs
    and symbols of culture that construct our perception of reality has replaced
    it to become ‘Hyperreal’, signs as a reality in its own right. This is what we perhaps risk when we become too
    infatuated with our digital self, the signifier of our self. We will be lost in a twisted state of psychosis, the
    hyperreal, out of touch with reality but to a point where it does not matter.

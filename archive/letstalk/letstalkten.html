               <p class="leftblock"> <span id="fadeout1">Haven’t you been listening? Looks like you need more advice. <br>Being a good listener is a proactive job. You need to act as an <br> </span>editor, encouraging stories to spill forth, finding interesting points, <br>summarising entire paragraphs and keeping the conversation on topic.  </p>
               <p class="rightblock">  So, listening is an active role?   </p>
               <p class="leftblock">No, not always. Sometimes what the other person needs is <br>for you to just hear them out. Be comfortable with silence, <br>it can encourage them to open up. We shouldn’t always try <br>to relate or try to problem solve. We can let them just rant. </p>
               <p class="leftblock">Of course, listening is only half of being a conversationalist. <br>Speaking is as difficult for some as listening is for others.  </p>
               <p class="rightblock">  I don't really know what to say  </p>
               <p class="leftblock" id="fade">Be honest and say what comes to mind. Even if its <br>a negative comment. Being authentic creates a chance <br>for deeper connections.   </p>

            <h2>
               An individual’s carbon consumption and a system of growth. 
            </h2>

            <p>
            In a system of economics where success is measured by economic growth or an increase in GDP, it is important that the demand for goods and services remain strong. Weak demand would mean there is less money being exchanged in the economy, meaning less money for companies, less money for wages, less money for me. In our capitalist world, where the incentive model is driven by acquiring money, cash, mullah, it is in everyone’s interest to continuing consuming more and more. However, while we continue to see our imaginary stand-in for value increase every year, the real world is being plundered in exchange of seeing those numbers go up. woo, nice. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The effects of the destructive acts fuelled by human activity is felt through climate change. As a human myself, how I am I to go about my human activity without slowly killing the planet? I can try to reduce my carbon foot print to a minimum but it seems that, apart from living in a self-sustaining farm isolated from society, participating in this world will default to at least a little bit of habitat destruction.

            I want to argue that for us to live guilt free, knowing our existence does not equal another step toward extinction, the change must occur from top-down. It may seem like I am deferring the blame, but consumers and individuals often don’t have the luxury of choosing the most environmentally friendly products and services. We can’t stop consuming altogether either. Instead, we are encouraged, to buy the next best thing. The current economic system is driven by consumerism, no one can afford to stop it.

            The system itself is working against any effort of stopping climate change. Individuals can’t change the system, it needs to come from our leaders, those in power. Culture, public perception and societal norms may gradually change towards a greener future, but changes need to happen now. Our democratically elected leaders must do what they were elected to do, work towards the collective interest of the people. And It is most likely in everyone interest that the world doesn’t burn up and die. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In that case, we need to pressure our leaders to make a change. Yet, when there are political agendas in place, government will divide, people will be distracted and climate change will be put on the back-burner again. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Consumption may seem like an issue that is down to the individual, but in a system of growth that requires consumption to remain high, we are just cogs in a machine. The free market that supposedly allocates resources efficiently does not take into account the future, environmental damages or carbon emissions. The oversight of the capitalist system in this regard results in market failure. The failure of markets to align to our human values is underlined by the inability of money to solve all problems. It instead corrupts our values, when we ought to rally towards a sustainable future, we succumb to the cultural pressure of having nice things (a consumer culture constructed to serve the system). 
            </p>

            <p>
            And we are convinced that this is how things are, were and always will be. We will go to our job, make our money and eventually be rich. And that will continue forever. For most of us this is ingrained into our notion of reality. Currency is as real as anything else, it really does hold value for us, perhaps too much value. 
            </p>

            <p>
            To exemplify this, a market for green things cropped up after public awareness surrounding climate change grew. I am also guilty of opting to buy these objects and it is a substitute for making real change. Its something we are already used to, consuming, it appeals to our new values, of being environmentally friendly and it serves the system, the free market.

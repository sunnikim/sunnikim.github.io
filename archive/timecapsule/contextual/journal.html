                SIMULATION

            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>
                During my foundation year at CSM I began to question my preconceived notions of graphic design and fine art. Specifically, I was concerned with the role of graphic design in society seen as a discipline for marketing and branding. This concern was amplified when I began reading ‘The Price of Inequality’ by Joseph Stiglitz and understood the consequences of unchecked free market economics. <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> 
            </p>

           
            <p>
                My inquiry started at the 2018 Hope to Nope exhibition, which showed me that graphic design was an integral part of the public engagement within politics. <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> It was capable of both selling the capitalist ideology as well as dismantling it. I saw that the principle function of graphic design to communicate countercultural ideas played a key part in activist and rebellious movements. 

            </p>

            <p>
                In the very same exhibition, Danah Abdullah, a lecturer from LCC, discussed the pitfalls of graphic design in bringing about real change. Operating under a capitalist system, are placards and slogans really enough to create a tangible impact or does it help in creating another subculture, another market for corporations to sell to? <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> 

            </p>

            <h2>thematic exposition</h2>

            <p>
                Amid the search for my position, as both an individual and graphic designer, within the modern capitalist society, I found myself in the midsts of a ‘simulation’. A state of affairs symptomatic of late-capitalism. One that utilised current technologies, was maintained by image culture and was inhabited by society. 

            </p>
            
            <p>
                This simulation is what Debord called the ‘spectacle society’, a state under which the representations of reality have replaced reality itself.<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> The rise of the spectacle society mirrored the rise of industrial mass production. To ensure the goods being produced were bought, mass consumption was fuelled by advertisements. In this time, the role of the graphic designer expanded to encompass a salesman. John Berger stated that the publicity image began to deliberately ‘steal the love of oneself and sell it back to the consumer at a price.’<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> Jean Baudrillard saw that objects were no longer desired solely for their utility. He saw that an object could hold functional value but also exchange value, symbolic value, and value as a sign.<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve come to understand, by studying Baudrillard and the Situationists, that consumption was the main driver of capitalism. In the pursuit of profit, the needs of the consumer were increasingly manufactured. Thus, producers no longer sold products but rather needs, and the consumer bought solutions rather than products. Under this system it did not take long for the state of representation to reach simulation, a state where everything is a reference with no referents. Baudrillard calls this a hyperreality, where representation is perceived as real or that it no longer matters. It is a state of affairs under which Debord’s spectacle society arises.<sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                I’d agree with Debord that the spectacle society lead inauthentic and impoverished lives. This phenomenological decline of the human experience in relation with one’s surroundings was also noted by Walter Benjamin. He discussed how mechanical reproductions of art strips the original of a certain aura that is linked with its uniqueness.<sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup> 

                However, I believe the consequences of the spectacle are not just that we lead less authentic lives but that our very reality is, in a sense, manufactured. We are forced to take a passive seat as experiences are becoming commodified, packaged and delivered to us. Frederic Jameson viewed this ‘depthlessness’, along with the loss of historicity and the mass media as the agents of ideological hegemony.<sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup>

            </p>

            <p>
                At this stage, late-capitalism is no longer simply an economic model, it has become the mode of life, a global cultural phenomenon. It is through our acclimatisation to simulation that we allow the dominant ideology to continue and false consciousness to foster. Under the superficial veneer of signifiers, is an self perpetual machine that seeks growth and profit at the expense of natural resources and human values. Even our schooling is teaching children to become less self-sufficient and indoctrinates the next generation with neo-liberalist values under the guise of education.<sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                Yet, it could be argued that almost no one is intending to perpetuate capitalism simply by participating in society. It is that capitalism has pervaded every sphere of life, and so cannot be escaped. For Zizek, to shed one’s ideology is to dissolve one’s sense of identity.<sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup> Observe Lacan’s idea of the Symbolic Order, that is language, social and cultural convention, and how it builds the framework of our reality.<sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup> For anyone who has grown into the spectacle society, it is almost impossible to escape it, let alone see it. The act is synonymous with the Buddhist notion of trying to see your own ego, it is impossible to see what is seeing. So then, to rid yourself of ideology is as difficult as achieving Enlightenment.<sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                This difficulty is what stumps me when I discuss the implications of late-capitalism, the spectacle and image culture on graphic communication design. I am fascinated not just on how one might go about graphic design without perpetuating the spectacle society but also how to combat it.

            <h2>research question</h2>
            <h3><i>
                So then the question becomes: How can I disrupt the flow of images, virtual experiences, the spectacle; to show the viewer they exist within the spectacular realm, a simulation; to create a certain cognitive dissonance and create a new system of seeing?</i>
            </h3>

            <h2>
                case study one
            </h2>

            <p>
                During my Unit 5 E&E Derive brief, I first encountered simulation. I could only describe it as a ‘flatness of reality’ and it was brought to my attention when I saw ‘the boy with the frog’ statue on my derive in Regent’s Park. The statue was in the middle of a well-kept, beautiful garden. The scene was inviting yet closed off by a chain fence, barring anyone from entering. The only hope of experiencing this statue was through sight. Nevertheless, people were satisfied with the image of the garden as an adequate substitute for entering and experiencing the garden. 
            </p>

            <figure>
              <img src="boy and frog statue.jpg">
              <figcaption >boy and frog statue</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                I found that the prospect of photo-taking became more appealing than the experience itself. If, according to Berger, oil paintings were safes in which the patron used to deposit the ‘visible’, to flaunt their possessions and wealth, I’d argue that the camera now is a new kind of ubiquitous safe.<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> The result of this seemingly innocent desire came at the cost of perpetuating the spectacle society. To take a photograph became no longer an act to preserve the moment, it became the reason for the moment itself. What remains is a representation without substance, without authentic motivation. The real is lost and the hyperreal maintained. Leaving us with an inauthentic life, empty and half lived. 
            </p>

            <p>
                My intention for this project was to disrupt the viewer’s relationship with digital photography by slowing the instantaneous aspect of the image. The outcome was a ‘pre-camera’, a coded software that took a photograph of the user before they were ready to pose. The user would click the ‘take photo’ button and a count down would begin. ‘3 - 2 - 1, smile!’ Except the photograph shown was taken at the start of the countdown. So the individual(s) in the photo were not ready and not posing. In a sense what the camera captured was a more authentic photo, one of reality as it is, unadulterated by the motivations of superficial image culture. This would create a certain cognitive dissonance in the viewer, dispelling their belief in the infallibility of the image. 
            </p>

            <h2>case study two</h2>

            <p>
                The Unit 7 ‘Classroom’ brief informed my self inquiry by encouraging a critical look at educational institutions. I started to take a critical look the ideologies that underlie modern institutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I began this unit by reflecting on my learning at CSM. I felt that I lost my passion and motivation to work because I was focusing heavily on the conceptual side of projects. In my ‘learning’ week I decided to learn ‘how to find joy in my work’ through the process of making. I tried to work spontaneously, letting my creative inclinations take over. When it came time to teach what I had learnt from this process to others, I was inspired by Bruce Mau’s incomplete manifesto for growth. So, I decided to write down a similar manifesto or an set of instructions on ‘how to find joy in your work, a note to myself and others’.
            </p>

            <p>
                I realised this outcome was problematic, because a goal as subjective as ‘finding joy’ cannot be summarised through a list of maxims. Additionally, what gave me the authority to tell others how to work? As Ivan Illich asserts in ‘Deschooling Society’, education is authoritarian as a few people set, specify and evaluate the personal goals of others.<sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup> In this instance, I was a teacher imposing my ideas of ‘how to find joy’ onto my students.
            </p>

            <p>
                In light of this understanding, I decided, instead, to create a physical space where participants could share skills and information. This would be a small experiment in realising Illich’s vision; where learning is achieved through non-hierarchal networks in which knowledge can be exchange. Thus, creating a self-sufficient society independent of authority or institutions.
            </p>

            <figure>
              <img src="classroom.png">
              <figcaption >a space for skill and information exchange</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                From this experience I found that The E&E platform lent itself well to my intention of disrupting the spectacle society. Through giving up my authority over the design process as a designer I created an experience in which participants can have an authentic discussion. This non reliance on established institutions is perhaps what is required in creating a new system of seeing.
            </p>

            <h2>case study two</h2>

            <p>
                The Museum unit began with writing a publication that seeks to answer, ‘What is the role of a museum?’. At first I simply reflected on how the museum was a noble place that preserves cultural items and educates the public. However, my readings from the Classroom unit encouraged me to think more critically and interrogate the underlying assumptions within my belief, unpacking the ideology of the museum. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I realised that the museum holds great power to sway the public opinion on matters. In the same way that Illich view education as a system which perpetuates neoliberalism, I saw that the museum can be seem as a form of cultural hegemony that reinforces the status quo. This was supported by my reading of ‘The Art Museum as Ritual’ by Carol Duncan, who argued that the physicality and architecture of the museum has been carefully constructed to induce a kind of religious and ritualistic viewing of the exhibits.<sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup> Thus, creating a temple of sorts for secularism which worships truth and science instead of religious gods.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                I learnt that writing as an outcome was effective in communicating my ideas surrounding institutions and cultural hegemony. This was especially true as I combined my skills in web development to create a digital article that aided the reading of my text. I believe that this kind of marriage of text and coding can help in creating a more general understanding of the spectacle society.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the second task we were required to create an interactive to include in the Postal Museum. In creating this outcome I worked with Kimberly Chuang. We observed how the path of the postcard quickly diverged from messaging and into souvenir. We also saw that the sentimentality and personal value that messages once held in handwritten postcards was lost. Inspired by our visit to the Ecovionaries exhibition and our experience of the interactive ‘win > < win’ by Rimini Protokoll, we decided to create an audio narrative experience.<sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup> This audio guide would situate the listener in a speculative future in which technology has rendered human communication obsolete, provoking the listener to reflect on the past forms of communication and the path communication technology is heading towards now.

              <figcaption >an audio narrative experiece <br> 'all your communications are being handled by digital life assistant'</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>analysis</h2>

            <p>
                Within each of my projects so far, there are possible answers to my research question: How can I disrupt the flow of images, virtual experiences, the spectacle; to show the viewer they exist within the spectacular realm, a simulation; to create a certain cognitive dissonance and create a new system of seeing?
            </p>

            <p>
                During Unit 5 this inquiry began and I directly engaged with the topic of hyperreality. Yet it was limited in its engagement with the social aspect of the spectacle society. As Debord saw ‘The spetacle is not a collection of images, rather it is a social relation among people, mediate by images’. While I disrupted one instance of hyperreality, our image culture, moving forward I must address the social aspect that utilises the digital image to create simulation.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this unit I also found the benefits of using the Situationist’s techniques such as psychogeography, derive and detournement. Such methods of understanding ones surroundings and altering it, subverting it will definitely aid my effort to disrupt spectacle society.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my second case study, I wasn’t as honest with myself as I could be. Although, reading Illich encouraged me to view institutions under a critical view, I did not fully commit to the idea of creating a non-hierarchal space. Giving up control as a designer was more difficult than I realised, during the open studio I had to be at this physical space conversing with people. Perhaps instead, I could design a system of tools that could allow people to create their own network of information. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In the third case study there are methods that I would like to utilise to tackle this issue further. I found writing to be an excellent tool in expressing my ideas about museum as agent of cultural hegemony. Additionally, I was able to create a website which enhanced the reading experience. This added design element allowed me to blend my writing skills with my design skills, creating an outcome which communicates my ideas effectively. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I also believe working with mediums that do not rely heavily on the visual would support my intention in disrupting the hyperreality. Our sense of sight is the one most heavily associated with reality and thus, is one that is most susceptible to falsehood. Perhaps by engaging with the ideas of simulation through other sense such as the aural sense, as I did in creating a audio narrative experience for the Museum brief, it will be effective in decreasing our reliance on our sight.
            </p>

            <h2>conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                Still, merely dealing with the symptoms of image culture is not enough. I need to truly engage with this topic to occur any real change, making sure my decisions are authentic and appropriate to my intentions. Or else I may fall into the many pitfalls of activism in graphic design and succumb to the simulation itself, only to be perceived as making a change while not really doing so. 
            </p>

            <p>
                My practice has been developing with image culture in mind and how to navigate the capitalist world as a graphic designer. This essay demonstrate engagement with this issue and organises my thoughts. I have learnt a lot from the previous units and even if the outcomes did not deal with spectacle society directly, I am planning on applying the same skills in stage three to tackle the problem of simulation in relation to graphic design. I will continue to not only question the role of graphic design in perpetuating hyperreality but how one can utilise communication design to disrupt it.
